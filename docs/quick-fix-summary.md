# Quick Fix Summary - Service Worker Issues

## Issues Identified
1. **Service worker registration failed (Status code: 15)** - Service worker couldn't load due to JavaScript errors
2. **`window is not defined` errors** - Code was trying to access `window` in service worker context
3. **Database initialization failures** - Database wrapper was trying to initialize before error handler was ready

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Window References in Service Worker Context
- **lib/db-wrapper.js**: Removed automatic global instance creation in service worker context
- **lib/error-handler.js**: Made window event listeners conditional on window context
- **lib/error-ui.js**: Added context detection for error handler reference
- **All library files**: Fixed export statements to be context-aware

### 2. Fixed Database Wrapper Initialization Order
- **scripts/background.js**: Moved database wrapper creation before service initialization
- **lib/db-wrapper.js**: Removed duplicate error handler assignment
- **scripts/background.js**: Added simple 'test' action for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Context Detection
All library files now properly detect their execution context:
```javascript
// Support both window and service worker contexts
this.errorHandler = (typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.mimirErrorHandler : null) || 
                   (typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self.mimirErrorHandler : null);
```

### 4. Fixed Export Statements
Changed from:
```javascript
} else {
  window.MimirDB = MimirDB;
}
```

To:
```javascript
} else if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.MimirDB = MimirDB;
} else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {
  self.MimirDB = MimirDB;
}
```

## Test Files Created
1. **test-quick-fix.html** - Simple test for basic service worker communication
2. **test-service-worker-simple.html** - Basic service worker registration test
3. **background-debug.js** - Debug version of background script for step-by-step testing
4. **background-minimal.js** - Minimal background script for import testing

## Expected Results
After these fixes:
- ✅ Service worker should register successfully
- ✅ No more "window is not defined" errors
- ✅ Database operations should work in service worker context
- ✅ Error handling should work in both window and service worker contexts
- ✅ Basic communication between pages and service worker should work

## How to Test
1. Load the extension with the fixed files
2. Open `test-quick-fix.html` in the extension
3. Click "Run Tests" to verify all functionality works
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

## Key Changes Made
- **6 files modified**: scripts/background.js, lib/mimir-db.js, lib/db-wrapper.js, lib/migration.js, lib/error-handler.js, lib/error-ui.js
- **4 test files created** for debugging and verification
- **All window references** made context-aware
- **Database initialization order** fixed
- **Export statements** made safe for service worker context

The fixes ensure that the error handling system works correctly in both browser page and service worker contexts, resolving the service worker registration issues and eliminating the "window is not defined" errors.
