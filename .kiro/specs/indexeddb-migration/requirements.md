# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves migrating the Mimir dashboard plugin's core data storage from chrome.storage.local (key-value storage) to IndexedDB (browser's built-in transactional database). The migration aims to solve current data management challenges including difficulty in querying, lack of structured viewing capabilities, and limited scalability. The new system will provide a high-performance, scalable, and easily manageable data foundation for long-term plugin development and feature expansion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to migrate from chrome.storage.local to IndexedDB, so that I can have structured, queryable, and scalable data storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use IndexedDB as the primary data storage mechanism
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL organize it in structured Object Stores (tables) instead of unstructured JSON strings
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL support indexed queries for fast retrieval by date ranges and other criteria
4. IF the migration fails THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and provide rollback capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a proper database schema with multiple Object Stores, so that different data types are organized logically and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL create a "history" Object Store with auto-incrementing id as primary key
2. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL create a "classified_cache" Object Store with date (YYYY-MM-DD) as primary key
3. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL create a "diaries" Object Store with date (YYYY-MM-DD) as primary key
4. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL create an "annual_reports" Object Store with year (YYYY) as primary key
5. WHEN the database is created THEN the system SHALL create a "settings" Object Store with key (string) as primary key
6. WHEN creating Object Stores THEN the system SHALL establish appropriate indexes for efficient querying

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the idb library wrapper, so that I can work with modern async/await syntax instead of complex IndexedDB callbacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing database operations THEN the system SHALL use the idb library for IndexedDB interactions
2. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL use async/await syntax for better code readability
3. WHEN handling database errors THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and logging
4. IF the idb library is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to native IndexedDB API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my existing data to be preserved during migration, so that I don't lose any historical information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration starts THEN the system SHALL backup existing chrome.storage.local data
2. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL transform and transfer all existing history records to the new schema
3. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL preserve all classified cache data in the new structure
4. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing diary entries with proper date mapping
5. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL transfer all user settings to the new settings Object Store
6. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL restore from backup and maintain original functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient querying capabilities, so that I can quickly retrieve data by date ranges and other criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying history data THEN the system SHALL support retrieval by timestamp ranges (e.g., "get all August entries")
2. WHEN accessing classified cache THEN the system SHALL allow direct lookup by date
3. WHEN retrieving diaries THEN the system SHALL support date-based queries and sorting
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL efficiently aggregate data across multiple Object Stores
5. WHEN performing queries THEN the system SHALL utilize indexes for optimal performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual database management capabilities, so that I can inspect and manage data through Chrome DevTools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome DevTools THEN the developer SHALL be able to view all Object Stores in a table-like interface
2. WHEN inspecting data THEN the developer SHALL be able to see structured records with clear field names
3. WHEN managing data THEN the developer SHALL be able to add, edit, and delete records directly through DevTools
4. WHEN debugging THEN the developer SHALL have clear visibility into database transactions and operations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the new storage system to be extensible, so that future features can be easily added without major restructuring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the schema THEN the system SHALL support easy addition of new Object Stores
2. WHEN adding new data types THEN the system SHALL not require changes to existing Object Stores
3. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL handle large volumes of historical data efficiently
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL support new index creation without data migration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that database issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN transactions are aborted THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
3. WHEN version upgrades occur THEN the system SHALL handle schema changes gracefully
4. IF database corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL detect and report the issue with recovery suggestions
